# TreadHUD

Welcome to TreadHUD.  TreadHUD is a group of applications used to gather speed data from a treadmill,
to save that data via a REST web service, and to then surface those running activities through a variety of front-ends.

Below the /src folder you'll find several projects:

* JD.TreadHud.Api - The API REST service for persisting activity data.
* JD.TreadHud.Domain - The business logic layer and models for the TreadHUD applications.
