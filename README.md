# TreadHUD API

Welcome to the TreadHUD API.  TreadHUD is a group of applications used to gather speed data from a treadmill,
to save that data via a REST web service, and to then surface those running activities through a variety of front-ends.

This project represents the API, or REST web service layer of the TreadHUD suite.
